API website: https://valorant-api.com/. I used the endpoint https://valorant-api.com/v1/agents/{agentUuid} to request data about a specific agent. The agentUuid depends on the user input.

The user can view details of Valorant agents by inserting the name of the agent and pressing the search button. The existing Valorant agents are: Astra, Breach, Brimstone, Chamber, Cypher, Fade, Gekko, Harbor, Jett, Kay/O, Killjoy, Neon, Omen, Phoenix, Raze, Reyna, Sage, Skye, Sova, Viper, and Yoru.
